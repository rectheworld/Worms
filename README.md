# Worms
Worms is a game made as an artistic expression for dealing with high maintenance data and data providers. 

The game play itself is a little tedious -- a player normally develops their own strategies to get the worms in order just like in any project management.  In the end it is quite soothing and rewarding to see them all sleep in the end. 

All code and graphics made by rectheworld.

### Game Objective 
There are 50 worms in the library. Your job is to make sure they are all fed and washed. A clean, fed worm will turn purple and fall asleep. 

The worms can be fed with the Feeder and washed in the Washer on the Red Carpet next to the old lady.

The feeder needs to be filled with food before the worms can eat from it. 

### Controls 
Arrow Keys to move around. 
C Key to pick up worms/food tins (C as in Copy)
V Key to place worms/food tins/Turn on washer (V as ins the Paste command)

You can carry up to 5 worms at once.

### Known Bugs 
About 25% of the time, some bugs will disappear and you will be unable to win. IDK why this happens or when.
